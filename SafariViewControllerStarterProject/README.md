### Tuts+ Tutorial: iOS 9: Getting Started With SFSafariViewController

#### Instructor: Jordan Morgan

Mobile apps and viewing content on the web are ubiquitous now. For years, iOS developers have been charged with either creating their own web viewing experience inside their app or handing off the URL to Safari. Both of these approaches bring inherent disadvantages that were previously unavoidable. That's all changed with iOS 9 and the introduction of the SFSafariViewController class. With it, you can now provide a full web viewing experience inside your app without having to spend important development time providing it.
